# Geoguessr Image Analysis
### Mason Mines: Up-and-Coming Geoguessr Fan
### Created for the Forge Labs Data Science Challenge



**Introduction:** Geoguessr is a game in which players are placed in a random google-street view somewhere across the globe, and are tasked with identifying where they are based on their surroundings. Points are awarded based on the distance between the guessed and actual location (ranging from 0-5000 points, with 5000 representing essentially adjacent guesses). Personally, I enjoy using the game's unique gameplay to learn more about different cultures of the world, and meet a community of people dedicated on doing the same.

**Purpose:** By analyzing street-view data, I hope to gain a greater understanding of global locations and set the groundwork for a much larger project designed to locate a user's location based on regional attributes of an image. At the very least, I hope to gain more information about the locations chosen during games to gain a competitive edge.


**Notes:**
- Code and analysis done in Jupyterlab, as I believe it is a better medium to show my design-process in addition to the code.
- Dependencies are in ```requirements.txt```. Full code on GitHub.
