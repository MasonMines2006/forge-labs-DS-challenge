    "**Introduction:** Geoguessr is a game in which players are placed in a random google-street view somewhere across the globe, and are tasked with identifying where they are based on their surroundings. Points are awarded based on the distance between the guessed and actual location (ranging from 0-5000 points, with 5000 representing essentially adjacent guesses).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** By analyzing street-view data, I hope to gain a greater understanding of global locations and their common attributes. At the very least, I hope to gain more information about the locations chosen during games to gain a competitive edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code and analysis done in Jupyterlab, as I believe it is a better medium to show my design-process in addition to the code."
